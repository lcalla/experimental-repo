## Custom emojis for your server

Emoji names must be at least 2 characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. For optimal emoji resolution, you can upload them in sizes up to 128x128 pixels, but they will be resized to 32x32 pixels. Additionally, the emoji file size must be smaller than 256kb.
